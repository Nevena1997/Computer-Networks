		Java’s implementation of UDP is split into two classes:
		DatagramPacket and DatagramSocket. The DatagramPacket class stuffs bytes of
		data into UDP packets called datagrams and lets you unstuff datagrams that
		you receive. A DatagramSocket sends as well as receives UDP datagrams. To
		send data, you put the data in a DatagramPacket and send the packet using a
		DatagramSocket. To receive data, you take a DatagramPacket object from a
		DatagramSocket and then inspect the contents of the packet. In UDP,
		everything about a datagram, including the address to which it is directed,
		is included in the packet itself; the socket only needs to know the local
		port on which to listen or send.
