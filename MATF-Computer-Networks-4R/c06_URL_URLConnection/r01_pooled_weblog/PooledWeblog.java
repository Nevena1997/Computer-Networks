    // "synchronize" as an argument). In this case we wish to synchronize a
    // LinkedList (reminder: List is an interface so we cannot instantiate a List,
    // so we can only use classes that implement List interface - such as LinkedList).

    // depending on what we need. When you use synchronized collections, operations are
    // thread-safe. Keep in mind that iterating over a collection IS NOT thread-safe,
    // so you need to manually provide synchronization in those cases.
