			 A buffer is a linear, finite sequence of elements of a specific primitive type.

			 limit, and position:
			 - Capacity is the number of elements it contains. The capacity of a buffer
			   is never negative and never changes.
			 - Limit is the index of the first element that should not be read or written.
			   A buffer's limit is never negative and is never greater than its capacity.
			 - Position is the index of the next element to be read or written. A buffer's
			   position is never negative and is never greater than its limit.

					In addition to methods for accessing the position, limit, and capacity

    				- clear() makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of channel-read or relative put
    				  operations: It sets the limit to the capacity and the position to zero.
    				- flip() makes a buffer ready for a new sequence of channel-write or relative get
    				  operations: It sets the limit to the current position and then sets the position to zero.
    				- rewind() makes a buffer ready for re-reading the data that it already contains:
    				  It leaves the limit unchanged and sets the position to zero.
