			// than byte arrays. Those smart buffers are part of new Java I/O.

			// written on a traditional OutputStream such as System.out. However, it’s more 
			// informative to stick with a pure, channel-based solution. Such a solution 
			// requires wrapping the OutputStream System.out in a channel.
			WritableByteChannel out = Channels.newChannel(System.out);
			
			// Pass this ByteBuffer object to the channel’s read() method. The channel
			// fills this buffer with the data it reads from the socket. It returns the
			// number of bytes it successfully read and stored in the buffer.
			while (client.read(buffer) != -1) {

				// connected to System.out. However, before you do that you have to
				// "flip" (not literally) the buffer so that the output channel starts
				// from the beginning of the data that was read rather than the end
				// These operations will be explained in the non-blocking client example.
				buffer.flip();
				out.write(buffer);

				// "Clearing" the buffer prepares it for read operation

			// So far, this is just an alternate vision of a program that could have
			// easily been written using streams. The really new feature comes if you
			// want the client to do something besides copying all input to output.
